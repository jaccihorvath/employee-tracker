## Installation
To begin using this application, the user must first open the terminal. Next, the user must install all dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```


## Usage
This application will be invoked by running the following command:

```bash
node server.js
```

Once invoked, the user will be presented the main menu, where a variety of options are available. Once a selection is made, the user will be prompted with a series of questions. Each question requires an answer and can be submitted by pressing enter.

The application then takes the user input to dynamically update a MySQL database that houses all employee information.
